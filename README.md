## Technologies

### Next.js
Next.js is a framework built on top of React that makes it easy to create server-rendered React applications. I decided to use this framework for the frontend application due to:

1. Server rendering: Next.js allows you to pre-render your React components on the server, which can improve the performance and SEO of your application.

2. Automatic code splitting: Next.js automatically splits your code into separate chunks, so that the user only needs to download the code that is necessary to render the current page. This can improve the load time of your application.

3. Easy page-based routing: Next.js uses a simple folder-based structure for routing, so you don't have to set up a separate routing library like React Router.

4. Static exporting: Next.js allows you to generate a static version of your application, which can be deployed to a hosting service like Netlify or GitHub Pages.
